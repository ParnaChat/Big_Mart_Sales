The sale is a lifeline of every business sales prediction that significantly impacts companies. The idea of the project is to extract information predict the sales. Accurate predictions benefit the organization to maintain the standard and increase the company's lifestyle by using different strategies. Typically, a prediction is based on the knowledge of previous studies with a deep focus on the conditions and then applies various factors, including customer's taste, culture, marketplace, and many more. In short, we can say that our prediction depends upon the previous study results. Every business needs to be good in profit, and profit does not mean that stock sales are at maximum but also avoid the extra stock. Every retailer must maintain the stock according to the requirements and check the flaws and drawbacks that lead the sales down.
